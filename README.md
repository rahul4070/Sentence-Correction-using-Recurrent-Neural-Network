# Sentence-Correction-using-Recurrent-Neural-Network

We human beings can communicate with each other, and express our feelings through words. We can see, hear and speak but when it comes to computers,(or machines) we cannot communicate with each other as computers only understand the language of zeros and ones only. At the lowest level, communication occurs not with words but through millions of zeros and ones. Also, the availability of big data, along with powerful computing and advance algorithms make it possible for us to communicate with machines. We may get the data in texts format from social media and also in speech format through sensors. But the raw data we often get is not in proper format because we often misspell or abbreviate words during texting and during speaking, we have regional accents, and we mumble, stutter, and borrow terms from other languages.Â 
The availability of this type of data results in the low performance of machine learning models. But when we do the data cleaning and apply the computation steps to convert the data to proper English text while preserving its semantic meaning as well, it results in improving the performance of the deep learning and machine learning models. In this case study, we will be using social media text messages (which may be corrupted English sentences) and convert them to proper English sentences with the help of deep learning models.

So you would get the code details above but if you want to see how I approached this problem than you can read my blog:- https://medium.com/@rahulBisht40/sentence-correction-using-recurrent-neural-networks-477f432e49f5
